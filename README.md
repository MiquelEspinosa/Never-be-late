# :clock4: BTime 
>*Never be late*


**BTime**, your new personal command line assistant that manages all your personal daily and weekly reminders.

Sounds fancy, but under the hood, it's just a python script that helps you schedule and manage more efficiently your **cron** time-based Unix-like tasks. 
  

## Installation
To install *BTime* in a Unix system, follow these steps:

### Requirements

+ Make sure you have `git`, `sox` and `pip3` installed .
    ```
    sudo apt install git python3-pip sox
    ```

### Steps


+ Navigate to the directory you want to install *BTime*
    ```
    cd /home/username/<my_btime_directory>
    ```
    
    
+ Clone this repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MiquelEspinosa/BTime.git
    ```


+ Move inside *Never-be-late* directory:
    ```
    cd BTime
    ```
+ Run autoinstall script (If do this don't need next steps):
    ```
   ./install.sh
    ```

+ Install `requirements` :
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    

+ Add **btime** symbolic link to `/usr/local/bin/btime`. (**Important:** Make sure you run this command inside the *Never-be-late* directory.)
    ```
    sudo ln -sf $(realpath main.py) /usr/local/bin/btime
    ```

+ Finally, you should see a welcoming message when you run:
    ```
    btime show
    ```
